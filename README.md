# Soil Classification Challenge â€“ ANNAM.AI

The soil classification challenge is to levere Artificial Intelligence for classifying soil types using image data. The classes are

-  Alluvial Soil  
-  Black Soil  
-  Clay Soil  
-  Red Soil

##  Approach

**EfficientNet-B2**, was selected as the final model for doing the classification tasks. The main comparisions was done between Resnet and Efficeintnet of which Efficientnet performed better. In the Efficeintnet family B0,B1 and B2 was compared by which EfficientnetB2 performed better by a small margin.
